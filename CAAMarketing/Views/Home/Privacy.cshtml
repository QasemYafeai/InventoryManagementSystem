        <h3>How to Start</h3>
        <p>
            To start you will need to register an account or login. If you need to register you will be given a password and then you will need to change
            it to some thing you will remember. Then an admin will give you your role that you need for whatever your job is. Once you login you will have access
            to all the other pages, and then you can get to work.
